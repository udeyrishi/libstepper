# libstepper
-----------------

**libstepper** is a cross-platform, hardware agnostic, C++ driver for controlling simple stepper motors. 


## Building

libstepper is a CMake C++ project, and requires a C++17 capable compiler. It has been tested to compile on macOS 10.3.3 (Apple clang 9.0.0), gcc 6.3.0 on Raspbian, and gcc 7.2.0 on Ubuntu. Although you can compile it however you build a regular CMake project, a build script has been included for conveniance.

```sh
$ ./build -h
usage: build [-h] [-d] [-c] [-a] [-r]

builds the project

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug  build the debug flavour instead of release
  -c, --clean  clean the flavour's temporary files and the build artifacts
               before building
  -a, --all    also build the test exectuable, besides the static lib
  -r, --run    if the test exectuable is built, also run it
```

Running `build -a` will build the linkable static lib in `out/linux/release/lib/libstepper.so` (for a linux target, for instance). You can then [link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1705972) the library to your project. The test executable will be present in `out/linux/release/bin/libsteppper-test`.

Alternatively (and preferably), if you use CMake in your project, libstepper's `CMakeLists.txt` exposes the `LIB_STEPPER` build artifact to any parent projects. So you can include libstepper as a child project, and link the static library to your build targets in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```
target_link_libraries(${MY_TARGET} ${LIB_STEPPER})
```

## Usage

Make sure to put the header files in the `inc` directory somewhere in your include path when linking the library.

* [stepper.hpp]: This is the main header file containing the `StepperDriver` driver class, and the `StepperDriverBuilder` builder class.
* [signal.hpp]: This file just contains the one, single-abstract-method class `DigitalSignalConsumer` that does exactly what the name implies--consume a digital signal. This acts as the interface that connects the `StepperDriver` to your platform's GPIO.
* [exception.hpp]: Contains the exception classes that the driver or the driver builder may throw.

The unit tests in [stepper_test.cpp] do a pretty good job of illustrating how to use the driver. They use a mock, in-memory, `DigitalSignalConsumer` called `SignalRecorder` for showing the usage, and for testing the driver behaviour. 

Your code might look something like this:

```cpp
#include "vendor/libstepper/inc/stepper.hpp"
#include "vendor/libstepper/inc/signal.hpp"
#include "vendor/libstepper/inc/exception.hpp"
#include <MyGPIOLib.hpp> // contains something like "digitalWrite" used below
#include "inc/MyPinConstants.hpp" // contains your GPIO pin constants like the ones used below
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

using namespace std;
using namespace libstepper;
using namespace std::chrono;

// Convert your GPIO API to DigitalSignalConsumer API, so that libstepper can interface with it
class MyGPIOSignalConsumer : public DigitalSignalConsumer {
public:
    MyGPIOSignalConsumer(const int gpioPinNumber) : gpioPinNumber(gpioPinNumber) {}

    void write(bool value) {
        digitalWrite(gpioPinNumber, value ? 1 : 0);
    }

private:
    const int gpioPinNumber;
};

int main() {
    MyGPIOSignalConsumer en(ENABLE_PIN);
    MyGPIOSignalConsumer a1(MOTOR_COIL1_TERMINAL1_PIN);
    MyGPIOSignalConsumer a2(MOTOR_COIL1_TERMINAL2_PIN);
    MyGPIOSignalConsumer b1(MOTOR_COIL2_TERMINAL1_PIN);
    MyGPIOSignalConsumer b2(MOTOR_COIL2_TERMINAL2_PIN);

    StepperDriver *driver = StepperDriverBuilder()
        .setCoil1Terminal1(a1)
        .setCoil1Terminal2(a2)
        .setCoil2Terminal1(b1)
        .setCoil2Terminal2(b2)
        .setEnableTerminal(en)
        .setRotationStepCount(200) // number of steps in 1 complete rotation for your stepper
        .setInitialRPM(initialRPM) // defaults to 0
        .setMaxSafeRPM(500) // defaults to UINT64_MAX
        .build();

    driver->step(50, CLOCKWISE);
    driver->step(50, COUNTER_CLOCKWISE);

    driver->rotateBy(90, CLOCKWISE);
    driver->rotateBy(-90, COUNTER_CLOCKWISE); // Same as 90 CLOCKWISE

    // Only calculates this theoretically.
    // The actual position would depend on your OS, and its scheduling policies.
    // On 100% guaranteed CPU time (e.g. on an RTOS), this should be very close to the real position.
    double position = driver->getPositionInDegrees();
    // position would be close to 180.0 (barring the double precision errors).

    thread drivingThread([driver] {
        // Would keep spinning indefinitely, until interrupt() is called from any thread.
        driver->drive(CLOCKWISE);
    });

    bool didChange = driver->setRPM(600); // exceeds max safe value. no-op. didChange == false

    this_thread::sleep_for(seconds(1));

    // Will interrupt the movement of the motor by turning off the enable pin, 
    // and stopping the stepper waveform. 
    // Will work for drive(), step(), and rotateBy()
    driver->interrupt();
    drivingThread.join();

    delete driver;
    return 0;
}
